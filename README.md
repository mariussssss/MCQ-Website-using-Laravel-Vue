## About this project

As part of my studies at [Heriot Watt](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh, I have to develop a website referencing MCQs. I decided to work with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) for the back end part and I used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the front end part.
